# Hive Helsinki: ft_printf
C, Endless debugging

## Challenge
The versatility of the printf function in C represents a great exercise in programming for us. This project is of moderate difficulty. It will enable you to discover variadic functions in C in a particularly relevant context as well as learn about a great example of a basic “dispatcher” in C via the use of an array of function’s pointers.

## Solution
Nothing spectacular, structs and loops.

## In hindsight
I opted for writing a helper function that had to handle way too much. This caused problems both with the school's style guide and debugging as the code turned into spaghetti.
