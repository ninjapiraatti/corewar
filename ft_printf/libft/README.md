# Hive Helsinki: Libft
C â€” A library of basic functions

## Challenge
In Hive we're not allowed to use any nice functions like printf etc. Libft is a project where we create 60 or so basic functions from scratch.

## Solution
Not much to it, I wrote the functions.

## In hindsight
Libft should be fast and reliable. Currently mine is mostly reliable.
